# Module Four Challenge: Web API Code Quiz

## Description
Taking advantage of the APIs provided to us by the browser, we are building a code quiz that dynamically populate the page by manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model). In addition to DOM manipulation this quiz makes note/use of:

- Timer Intervals
- Event Listeners
- Default Behavior (and preventing it)
- Local Storage/Objects (JSON)

DOM manipulation without tools like jQuery requires specific and somewhat wordy syntax. Some issues arose when combining various aspects of the assignment, but were ultimately solved. Credits below.

## Acceptance Criteria

Our quiz must ,at minimum, contain the following functionality: 

```
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
## Mock-Up
